# Tweet Splitter

Tweet Splitter is a simple web tool that helps you split long tweets into multiple shorter ones without losing the meaning. This is particularly useful for Twitter users who want to share longer texts within the character limit.

## How to Use

1. Open the web page.
2. Enter your tweet in the provided text area.
3. Click the "Split Tweets" button to split the tweet.
4. The tool will split your tweet into multiple shorter tweets, preserving sentence structures.
5. You can click on any individual tweet to copy it to your clipboard.
6. The tool also provides statistics on the number of characters, words, paragraphs, and sentences in your input.

## Styling

The application uses the "Ubuntu" font from Google Fonts for a clean and modern look. The color scheme and design are optimized for easy reading and interaction.

## Development

The application is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the "script.js" file to handle user interactions and tweet splitting logic. The "style.css" file contains the styling rules for the application.
